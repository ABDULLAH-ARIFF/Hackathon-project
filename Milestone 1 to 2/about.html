<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; padding: 70px; color: white;">    Welcome to our website! My name is Abdullah, and I am the creator behind this project. This journey began as a <br> hackathon challenge where I developed a static resume builder. With a passion for coding and a drive to create <br>user-friendly tools, I embarked on this project to help individuals craft professional resumes with ease.

<br>Our mission is to provide a seamless and efficient experience for users, enabling them to showcase their skills and <br>achievements effectively. We believe in the power of simplicity and functionality, and our resume builder reflects <br>these values.

<br>Thank you for visiting our site. We hope our tool helps you in your career journey!
